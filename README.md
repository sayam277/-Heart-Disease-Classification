# Introduction
Early detection and classification of heart disease play a crucial role in preventive healthcare and treatment planning. This project aims to develop machine learning models capable of accurately identifying individuals at risk of heart disease based on a variety of clinical and diagnostic parameters.

# Algorithms Used
The following machine learning algorithms are utilized in this project:

# Logistic Regression: Used for binary classification, Logistic Regression models the probability of a binary outcome and is well-suited for medical diagnosis tasks.
# K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN): KNN classifies cases based on the majority class of its k nearest neighbors in the feature space, making it a simple and effective algorithm for classification tasks.
# Decision Trees: Decision Trees split the feature space into regions based on feature values, enabling hierarchical classification and providing interpretability.
# Random Forests: Random Forests consist of an ensemble of decision trees and aggregate their predictions to improve accuracy and robustness.
# Support Vector Machines (SVM): SVM finds the optimal hyperplane that separates classes in the feature space with the maximum margin, making it effective for high-dimensional classification tasks.
# K Neighbors Classifier: Similar to KNN, the K Neighbors Classifier classifies cases based on the majority class of its k nearest neighbors, offering flexibility in parameter tuning and performance.
